# MediaPipe Hands Detection with OpenCV
This README provides instructions on how to run the provided Python code for hand detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV.

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

Python: You'll need Python 3.x installed on your system.

OpenCV: Install OpenCV using pip if it's not already installed


# Running the Code
Clone the repository or download the code file (mediapipe_hand_detection.py) to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the code file.

Run the code using the following command:
python handdetector.py
A window will open displaying your webcam feed with hand landmarks detected in real-time. By default, it uses your default camera (usually ID 0). You can change the camera source by modifying the cv2.VideoCapture() argument.

To exit the program, press the 'Esc' key (27 on most keyboards). This will close the webcam feed window and terminate the application.

# Configuration
You can adjust the following parameters in the code:

min_detection_confidence: Minimum confidence score for a hand detection. Increase this value for stricter detection.

min_tracking_confidence: Minimum confidence score for tracking hand landmarks. Increase this value for more stable tracking.


# Notes
Ensure your webcam is properly connected and accessible by your system.

This code captures the webcam feed and processes it in real-time. To use a pre-recorded video instead of the webcam, modify the code accordingly.

Make sure to have good lighting conditions for optimal hand detection.
